Conversa Image Processing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
This application leverages the use of two machine learning models to be able to use a camera to
recognise a hand from the background and detect sign language symbols and distiguish between
them. Additionally, it allows users to add symbols together to form words with the following 
abilities:
- Add - Adds the currently highlighted sign langugage symbol onto the text view on the top of
  the screen 
- Backspace - Removes the last added letter on the text view
- Clear - Removes all letters that are currently on the text view
- Enter - Works in conjunction with Conversa to send the value currently on the text view as
  translated sign language to the Chat Screen.
